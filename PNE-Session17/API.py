APIs

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications
to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone,
youâ€™re using an API.

When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server.
The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The
application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what
an API is - all of this happens via API.


The web was initially created for humans: we can get html pages with images, information and so on. However, many web
servers have another interface for the applications to connect and get data, using the HTTP protocol. A very extended
interface is the API Rest. The clients (Apps) request information to the servers. The latter return that information as
json files.
