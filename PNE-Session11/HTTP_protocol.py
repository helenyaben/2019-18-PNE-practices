HTTP PROTOCOL

1.INTRODUCTION TO THE HTTP PROTOCOL

HTTP protocol is the language spoken between a browser (client) and a web server.

HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model. A web browser, for example, may be
the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server. The client submits an HTTP
request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs
other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion
status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.

The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate
with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and
how the servers respond to these requests.
