RESPONSE WITH HTML CONTENTS

Let's response with our first web page written in HTML. We know nothing about HTML. It is the language used for the
creating web pages,that describes the structure of the document.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

In our server we are changing the contents. Instead of responding with a string, we will send a message in HTML. It is
important to change the Content-type header from text/plain to text/html for indicating that we are sending HTML code
instead of plain text.
